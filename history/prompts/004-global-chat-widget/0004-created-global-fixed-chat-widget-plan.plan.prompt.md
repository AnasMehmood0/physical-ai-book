## Prompt

/sp.plan

## Response snapshot

The implementation plan for the "Global Fixed Chat Widget (Corner Bubble)" has been created.

**Branch:** `004-global-chat-widget`
**Plan File:** `specs/004-global-chat-widget/plan.md`

**Generated Artifacts:**
*   `specs/004-global-chat-widget/research.md`
*   `specs/004-global-chat-widget/data-model.md`
*   `specs/004-global-chat-widget/contracts/frontend-contracts.md`
*   `specs/004-global-chat-widget/quickstart.md`
