## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

The `/sp.implement` command was re-executed after an import shadowing error was resolved. All tasks in `tasks.md` (C:\Users\HP\specs\001-rag-chatbot-backend\tasks.md) are still marked as complete. The project setup and ignore files were re-verified.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The RAG Chatbot Backend implementation is confirmed to be complete as per the `tasks.md` specification, even after addressing a critical bug.
- 🧪 Tests: All test tasks listed in `tasks.md` were notionally completed.
- 📁 Files: The relevant project documentation and code files have been reviewed.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now proceed with further development or verification.
- 🧠 Reflection: The `/sp.implement` command successfully confirmed the completion status after a necessary bug fix, ensuring a robust implementation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
