## Response snapshot

The `tasks.md` file has been successfully created at `specs/001-syllabus-restructuring/tasks.md`.

**Summary of Generated Tasks:**
*   **Total tasks**: 15
*   **Tasks per user story**:
    *   Setup: 3 tasks
    *   User Story 1 (Restructure Documentation): 12 tasks
*   **Parallel opportunities**: Identified within User Story 1 for creating directories and `_spec.md` files for different modules.
*   **Independent test criteria**: The documentation site's sidebar navigation and URL paths should match the new syllabus structure, and all module `_spec.md` files are present and correctly populated.
*   **Suggested MVP scope**: User Story 1 (Restructure Documentation).
*   **Format validation**: All tasks adhere to the specified checklist format.

The tasks are now ready for implementation.
