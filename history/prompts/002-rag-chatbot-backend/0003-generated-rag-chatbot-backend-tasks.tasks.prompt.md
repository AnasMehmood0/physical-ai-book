## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

The `tasks.md` file for the "RAG Chatbot Backend" feature has been generated.

**Path:** `specs/002-rag-chatbot-backend/tasks.md`

**Summary:**
*   **Total Tasks:** 20
*   **User Story 1 (Content Ingestion):** 7 tasks
*   **User Story 2 (Question Answering):** 7 tasks
*   **MVP Scope:** Both User Story 1 and 2 are considered the MVP. They can be developed in parallel.

The tasks are organized by user story, follow the Test-First principle, and are ready for implementation. You can now proceed with `/sp.implement`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed, actionable task list for implementing the RAG chatbot backend.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/002-rag-chatbot-backend/tasks.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: The task generation was successful. The generated `tasks.md` provides a clear path for implementation, broken down by user stories.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with the `/sp.implement` command to start implementing the tasks.
