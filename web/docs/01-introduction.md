# Introduction to Physical AI

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with and learn from the physical world through embodied agents like robots. Unlike traditional AI that operates in virtual environments, Physical AI combines computational intelligence with physical sensors and actuators to perceive, reason, and act in real-world environments.

## Key Components

Physical AI systems typically consist of:

- **Sensors**: Cameras, LiDAR, IMU, force/torque sensors
- **Actuators**: Motors, servos, pneumatic/hydraulic systems
- **Control Systems**: Algorithms for motion planning and execution
- **Perception Systems**: Computer vision, object recognition
- **Learning Mechanisms**: Reinforcement learning, imitation learning

## Applications

Physical AI has diverse applications including:

- Service robotics
- Autonomous vehicles
- Industrial automation
- Healthcare robotics
- Educational robots
- Assistive technologies

## Challenges

The field faces several challenges:

- Real-world uncertainty and noise
- Safety and reliability requirements
- Energy efficiency
- Human-robot interaction
- Scalability and generalization

## Chapter Summary

This introduction provides the foundation for understanding Physical AI as a discipline that bridges artificial intelligence and robotics. Throughout this book, we'll explore the technical foundations, implementation strategies, and practical applications of embodied AI systems.
